\section{Problem description}

License plates are used for uniquely identifying motorized vehicles and are
made to be read by humans from great distances and in all kinds of weather
conditions.

Reading license plates with a computer is much more difficult. Our dataset
contains photographs of license plates from various angles and distances. This
means that not only do we have to implement a method to read the actual
characters, but also have to determine the location of the license plate and
its transformation due to different angles.

We will focus our research on reading the transformed characters on the
license plate, of which we know where the letters are located. This is because
Microsoft recently published a new and effective method to find the location of
text in an image.

Determining what character we are looking at will be done by using Local Binary
Patterns. The main goal of our research is finding out how effective LBPs are in
classifying characters on a licenseplate.

In short our program must be able to do the following:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Use perspective transformation to obtain an upfront view of license
          plate.
    \item Reduce noise where possible.
    \item Extract each character using the location points in the info file.
    \item Transform character to a normal form.
    \item Create a local binary pattern histogram vector.
    \item Match the found vector with a learning set.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Solutions}

Now that the problem is defined, the next step is stating our basic solutions. This will
come in a few steps as well.

\subsection{Transformation}

A simple perspective transformation will be sufficient to transform and resize
the plate to a normalized format. The corner positions of license plates in the
dataset are supplied together with the dataset.

\subsection{Reducing noise}

Small amounts of noise will probably be suppressed by usage of a Gaussian
filter. A real problem occurs in very dirty license plates, where branches and
dirt over a letter could radically change the local binary pattern. A question
we can ask ourselves here, is whether we want to concentrate ourselves on these
exceptional cases. By law, license plates have to be readable. Therefore, we
will first direct our attention at getting a higher score in the 'regular' test
set before addressing these cases. Considered the fact that the LBP algorithm
divides a letter into a lot of cells, there is a good change that a great
number of cells will still match the learning set, and thus still return the
correct character as a best match. Therefore, we expect the algorithm to be
very robust when dealing with noisy images.

\subsection{Extracting a letter}

Because we are already given the locations of the characters, we only need to
transform those locations using the same perspective transformation used to
create a front facing license plate. The next step is to transform the
characters to a normalized manner. The size of the letter W is used as a
standard to normalize the width of all the characters, because W is the widest
character of the alphabet. We plan to also normalize the height of characters,
the best manner for this is still to be determined.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Crop the image in such a way that the character precisely fits the
          image.
    \item Scale the image to a standard height.
    \item Extend the image on either the left or right side to a certain width.
\end{enumerate}

The resulting image will always have the same size, the character contained
will always be of the same height, and the character will alway be positioned
at either the left of right side of the image.

\subsection{Local binary patterns}

Once we have separate digits and characters, we intent to use Local Binary
Patterns to determine what character or digit we are dealing with. Local Binary
Patters are a way to classify a texture based on the distribution of edge
directions in the image. Since letters on a license plate consist mainly of
straight lines and simple curves, LBP should be suited to identify these.

To our knowledge, LBP has yet not been used in this manner before. Therefore,
it will be the first thing to implement, to see if it lives up to the
expectations. When the proof of concept is there, it can be used in the final
program.

Important to note is that due to the normalization of characters before
applying LBP. Therefore, no further normalization is needed on the histograms.

Given the LBP of a character, a Support Vector Machine can be used to classify
the character to a character in a learning set. The SVM uses

\subsection{Matching the database}

Given the LBP of a character, a Support Vector Machine can be used to classify
the character to a character in a learning set. The SVM uses the collection of
histograms of an image as a feature vector.  The SVM can be trained with a
subsection of the given dataset called the ''Learning set''. Once trained, the
entire classifier can be saved as a Pickle object\footnote{See
\url{http://docs.python.org/library/pickle.html}} for later usage.

\section{Implementation}

In this section we will describe our implementations in more detail, explaining
choices we made.

\subsection*{Licenseplate retrieval}

In order to retrieve the license plate from the entire image, we need to perform
a perspective transformation. However, to do this, we need to know the 
coordinates of the four corners of the licenseplate. For our dataset, this is
stored in XML files. So, the first step is to read these XML files.

\paragraph*{XML reader}



\paragraph*{Perspective transformation}

Once we retrieved the cornerpoints of the licenseplate, we feed those to a
module that extracts the (warped) licenseplate from the original image, and
creates a new image where the licenseplate is cut out, and is transformed to a
rectangle.

\subsection*{Noise reduction}

The image contains a lot of noise, both from camera errors due to dark noise 
etc., as from dirt on the license plate. In this case, noise therefore means 
any unwanted difference in color from the surrounding pixels.

\paragraph*{Camera noise and small amounts of dirt}

The dirt on the licenseplate can be of different sizes. We can reduce the 
smaller amounts of dirt in the same way as we reduce normal noise, by applying
a gaussian blur to the image. This is the next step in our program.\\
\\
The gaussian filter we use comes from the \texttt{scipy.ndimage} module. We use
this function instead of our own function, because the standard functions are
most likely more optimized then our own implementation, and speed is an
important factor in this application.

\paragraph*{Larger amounts of dirt}

Larger amounts of dirt are not going to be resolved by using a Gaussian filter.
We rely on one of the characteristics of the Local Binary Pattern, only looking
at the difference between two pixels, to take care of these problems.\\
Because there will probably always be a difference between the characters and
the dirt, and the fact that the characters are very black, the shape of the
characters will still be conserved in the LBP, even if there is dirt
surrounding the character.

\subsection*{Character retrieval}

The retrieval of the character is done the same as the retrieval of the license
plate, by using a perspective transformation. The location of the characters on
the licenseplate is also available in de XML file, so this is parsed from that
as well.

\section{Finding parameters}

Now that we have a functioning system, we need to tune it to work properly for
license plates. This means we need to find the parameters. Throughout the 
program we have a number of parameters for which no standard choice is
available. These parameters are:\\
\\
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
	Parameter 			& Description\\
	\hline
	$\sigma$  			& The size of the gaussian blur.\\
	\emph{cell size}	& The size of a cell for which a histogram of LBPs will
	                      be generated.

\end{tabular}
